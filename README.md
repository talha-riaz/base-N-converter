# base-N-converter
A simple implementation of decimal to base-N converter in C.

How it works?
The program is run from Terminal and takes Command Line arguments. The Decimal number to convert is always the first argument provided. The second argument is the Base to which we want the decimal number to be converted in. 
By default, running the program with only one argument converts the Decimal number to binary. To convert to any other base, specify which Base-N in the second argument.
